# Independent Celln model authority

Tool approval does not grant permission to spend a model credential. The
control-plane `cellnauthority.ModelLoader` reads a separate operator-configured
ConfigMap, with its document in `data["model-policy.json"]`. Its location must
come from trusted deployment configuration, not an AgentRun. RBAC must deny
tenant writes; labels and same-named tenant ConfigMaps do not prove ownership.
The model policy source must differ from each of the three tool-grant sources.

The `sympozium.ai/celln-model-policy-v1` document contains:

- `agent` and `runtime`: complete `Subject` identities from the reviewed
  selection (namespace, name, UID, generation and full-spec SHA256).
- `provider`, `model`, `url`: exact model authority. The currently supported
  contract is `deepseek`, an explicit model, and
  `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`.
- `credentialProfile`: an opaque 1–64 character alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen
  name for an independently configured host credential mapping. Not a path,
  secret value, Kubernetes Secret reference, or authorization by itself.
- `maxRequests`: 1–6, at least the selected runtime's maximum turns.
- `maxOutputTokens`: 512, matching the current host broker contract.
- `maxTotalOutputTokens`: 512–3072 and at least `maxTurns * 512`, matching the
  host's non-refundable reservation for every configured JSON Harness turn.
  Insufficient funding refuses; it must never be silently expanded.

Resolution revalidates the frozen selection, reads the policy, compares the
live run's full identity and explicit model options, then revalidates selection
and policy revision again. Nonempty tenant credential references, provider
headers, model discovery, node selectors and unsupported thinking modes refuse
instead of falling back to an ambient provider or credential. Documents are
bounded to 64 KiB and unknown fields or trailing JSON refuse.

The resulting `sympozium.ai/celln-model-approval-v1` record pins the complete
frozen-selection SHA256, run-derived caller, policy content and source
namespace/name/UID/resourceVersion/exact-document SHA256. Revalidation compares
the entire record and never substitutes a new plan or execution ID.

Operators can add `--model-policy CONFIGMAP` to `celln-tool plan` or
`celln-tool compose`, along with `--run` and the existing grant-source flags.
The policy resides in `--grant-namespace`. Composition revalidates model
approval after building artifacts. These commands print a `modelApproval`
observation and keep `executionAuthorized: false`.

## Per-connection request policy (model gateway)

On the gateway-mediated path the request settings of an Agent belong to its own
namespaced `ModelConnection`, not to a fleet-wide backend. Two optional fields
of `spec` carry them, and the model gateway enforces both on every invocation
from the live spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelConnection
metadata: {name: team-model, namespace: team-a}
spec:
  provider: openai
  protocol: openai-chat
  endpoint: https://api.example.com/v1/chat/completions
  secretRef: team-model-key
  models: [example-model]
  maxOutputTokens: 2048
  parameters:
    temperature: 0.7
    chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}
```

- `maxOutputTokens`: the output tokens one request may ask for, 256–4096;
  omitted means 512. A request above it refuses (`MODEL_AUTH_FORBIDDEN`). The
  turn's own output-token cap from the signed decision still applies, so a
  raised bound is only usable when the turn is funded for it.
- `parameters`: a JSON object merged into every provider request. The same
  rules as fleet backend parameters apply (one implementation,
  `api/v1alpha1.ValidateModelParameters`): at most 16 top-level keys matching
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`, 3 levels deep, 2048 bytes serialized, no `null`, and
  none of the fields the host owns: `model`, `messages`, `system`, `stream`,
  `stream_options`, `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `n`, `tools`,
  `tool_choice`, `functions`, `function_call`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `user`.
  A connection that breaks a rule is invalid: nothing resolves or runs on it.

Both are **host-pinned operator policy**. The guest never sees them and cannot
set or override them: a guest body that carries any key of the connection's
`parameters` is refused outright (even with an equal value) rather than merged,
and top-level guest fields must use the exact provider field names, so a key
cannot be aliased by letter case. Precedence therefore never arises: a
forwarded body holds the guest's fields and the operator's parameters, and the
two sets are disjoint.

The guest body is validated, canonicalised and digested for the reservation
exactly as before, and its integer-only number rule is unchanged (a guest
`"temperature": 0.7` still refuses). Parameters are appended to the canonical
guest body only afterwards and never pass through that canonicaliser, so
fractional values such as `temperature: 0.7` are forwarded as the operator
wrote them. The reservation's request digest covers the guest body alone.

Both fields are covered by the decision's `route.modelConnectionSpecSha256`,
which the issuer and the gateway compute from the same view of the spec
(`ModelConnectionSpec.DigestView`). Because decision digests use integer-only
canonical JSON, `parameters` enters that view as one string: its key-sorted
compact JSON text. A connection without `parameters` digests exactly as it did
before the fields existed. The gateway re-reads the spec on every invocation,
so editing `parameters` or `maxOutputTokens` refuses every run pinned to the old
spec (`MODEL_ROUTE_CHANGED`) instead of silently retargeting it; new runs pick
up the new policy.

The fields are only valid on gateway-mediated connections (`secretRef`, or no
credential). A connection with a host `credentialProfile` is served by the
native host broker, which does not read them, so combining them is refused.

## Remaining issuance boundary

### Catalogue-derived execution candidate

Operator `celln-tool plan` accepts paired `--execution-mote` and
`--execution-closure` hashes with `--run` and `--model-policy`. These name actual
packaging outputs, not the runtime profile's template mote. The command derives
a `celln.dev/v1alpha3` request from the revalidated frozen selection and live
AgentRun: exact task/persona/model, runtime executable, ordered borrowed tools,
schema/loop limits, intersected memory/output ceilings, and the lower of the
run timeout and runtime ceiling. It does not accept a caller-provided tool list
or task override at this stage.

The deterministic execution ID binds the frozen run/selection/model approval
and materialized artifact hashes. A retry must persist/reuse this candidate;
changed approval must be reconciled, not silently turned into a fresh attempt.
SessionKey is only correlation metadata here: this is not a transcript or
conversation implementation. Pod environment, sidecars/skills, parent runs,
custom lifecycle/storage, server/dry-run modes, existing low-level Celln bindings
and unsupported context settings refuse instead of being silently discarded.

The candidate contains a zero placeholder model-grant hash. It is **not
authorized for dispatch**. Hash syntax validation does not authenticate the
packaging outputs. Trusted provisioning must verify their exact composition
sources, obtain the actual host request binding and issue a grant after fresh
approval checks. The host issuer must independently verify artifacts and model
policy. Tests include passing the generated request to the actual Celln
`harness-binding` command; that is parser/binding compatibility, not KVM/model
execution or deployed controller proof.

### Host bridge still required

The model-policy resolver reads no credentials, writes no Kubernetes resources or
host grant files, and performs no model calls. Tests use a fake Kubernetes API;
they are not deployment/RBAC or live-model proof. Observed rereads are not an
atomic transaction, lease or fleet-wide withdrawal guarantee.

The host issuer must still independently authenticate its control-plane caller,
resolve `credentialProfile` through operator-owned host configuration, validate
the actual admitted/prewarmed mote and composed closure, bind exact runtime,
borrowed tools, persona and budgets, and publish a content-addressed grant only
after fresh policy checks. Distribution, issuer/controller integration and the
catalogue-backed real-model E2E remain required. An uploaded approval JSON or
successful prewarm observation alone must never create model authority.

The [local operator issuance bridge](celln-local-issuance.md) now connects these
approvals to the real host issuer, including failure cleanup and explicit
withdrawal. It is not yet an autonomous deployed controller or a crash-safe
fleet approval watcher; see its recovery limits before use.
